# Claude Code Configuration

This file provides guidance for AI agents working on the Solenoid codebase.

## Verification Workflow

Before pushing any code changes, you **must** complete the following verification steps in order:

### 1. Run the Code Simplifier Plugin

After making any code changes, always start by running the code simplifier plugin to ensure the code is clean and follows best practices.

The code-simplifier is an Anthropic-published agent plugin for Claude Code. Run it via: the code-simplifier:codesimplifier agent


### 2. Run Unit Tests

Execute the test suite to ensure all tests pass:

```bash
bun test
```

### 3. Functional Testing with Agent Harness

Use the agent harness to functionally test your changes before pushing:

```bash
bun test tests/e2e/harness-integration.test.tsx
```

## Verification Checklist

Before pushing code, confirm all of the following:

- [ ] Code simplifier plugin has been run
- [ ] All unit tests pass
- [ ] Functional tests via agent harness pass

## Important Notes

- **Never push code that fails any verification step**
- If any step fails, fix the issues and re-run the entire verification workflow
- When in doubt, run the full verification suite again before pushing
